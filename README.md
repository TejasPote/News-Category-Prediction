# News Category Prediction

The python notebook contains an implementation of News Category prediction using Naive Bayes algorithm written from scratch. The dataset contains news headlines and their categories. First we apply some preprocessing to the sentences in the data. We remove the punctuations using the string library, convert all the words to lower case characters and also remove stopwords using nltk library. The words are also stemmed using porterstemmer. Thus, we obtain a dictionary of words. We now compute the prior probabilities of each of the news category based on the number of words from the dictionary that appear in the sentences with those categories. Next, we process the words in the test set in a similar way and then compute the class conditional probabilites using a simple logic: If the word appeared in that category, we divide its count by the total count of the words in that category. If it didn't appear, we assign a very small probability with it. Thereby, we can obtain the posterior probabilities for all categories for every training example by multiplying the respective class conditional probabilities with the priors. Finally, the category of the particular example is the label associated with maximum posterior probability.  
Note: The extremely good fit on the test set is obtained as the data set is relatively small.
